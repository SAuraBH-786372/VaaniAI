// FAQ Data
export const mockFAQs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    category: "General",
    question: "What is Smart Captions and how does it work?",
    answer: "Smart Captions is an AI-powered captioning platform that provides adaptive, context-aware captions for video and audio content. Our system uses advanced natural language processing to generate captions in three complexity levels (Easy, Medium, Verbatim) and enhances them with speaker identification, emotional context, glossary terms, and Indian Sign Language (ISL) integration. Simply upload your content or integrate our API, and our AI handles the rest."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    category: "General",
    question: "Who can benefit from Smart Captions?",
    answer: "Smart Captions is designed for everyone! Students can better understand complex lectures, professionals can follow meetings more effectively, content creators can make their videos more accessible, educators can enhance their teaching materials, and individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can access content with ISL support. Our adaptive modes ensure that users of all comprehension levels can benefit."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    category: "Features",
    question: "What are the different caption modes?",
    answer: "We offer three caption modes: <strong>Easy Mode</strong> simplifies complex language into everyday terms with emojis and visual cues, perfect for quick understanding or language learners. <strong>Medium Mode</strong> balances clarity with detail, ideal for most users. <strong>Verbatim Mode</strong> provides word-for-word transcription for academic or professional use where exact wording matters. You can switch between modes anytime during playback."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    category: "Features",
    question: "How does the ISL (Indian Sign Language) integration work?",
    answer: "When you tap on highlighted key terms in captions, you'll see a popup with the definition and an ISL video clip demonstrating the sign. Our ISL library covers thousands of common terms and is continuously expanding. This feature is particularly valuable for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India, making educational and professional content more accessible."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    category: "Features",
    question: "What is speaker identification and why is it useful?",
    answer: "Speaker identification automatically detects different speakers in your content and assigns each a unique color and label. This makes it easy to follow conversations, debates, or multi-speaker lectures. You can see at a glance who's speaking, which is especially helpful for deaf users who can't rely on voice recognition, and for anyone reviewing recorded meetings or interviews."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    category: "Features",
    question: "Can I customize the glossary terms?",
    answer: "Yes! Pro and Enterprise users can add custom glossary terms specific to their field or organization. Simply define the term, add a simple explanation, and optionally upload an ISL video. Custom terms will be automatically highlighted in your captions and available in the glossary popup. This is perfect for technical fields, specialized industries, or educational institutions."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "Is there a free trial for the Pro plan?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer a 14-day free trial of the Pro plan with no credit card required. You'll get full access to all Pro features including unlimited hours, all caption modes, 12 languages, and API access. After the trial, you can choose to subscribe or continue with our generous Free plan."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "What happens if I exceed my monthly hours on the Free plan?",
    answer: "If you reach your 5-hour monthly limit on the Free plan, you'll receive a notification. You can either upgrade to Pro for unlimited hours, or wait until the next month when your quota resets. We'll never delete your existing captions or contentâ€”they remain accessible even if you're over quota."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
    answer: "Absolutely! You can cancel your Pro subscription at any time from your account settings. You'll continue to have Pro access until the end of your current billing period, then automatically switch to the Free plan. No cancellation fees, no questions asked. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "What's included in Enterprise pricing?",

We integrate with popular platforms including YouTube, Vimeo, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and custom video players via our JavaScript SDK. Our API also supports real-time streaming for live captions."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    category: "Technical",
    question: "How accurate are the captions?",
    answer: "Our AI achieves 98.5% accuracy on clear audio with minimal background noise. Accuracy depends on audio quality, accents, technical terminology, and background noise. We continuously improve our models through machine learning and user feedback. Pro users can also correct captions, which helps train our AI to be even more accurate for their specific use case."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    category: "Technical",
    question: "What languages do you support?",
    answer: "We currently support 12 languages: English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Spanish, and French. Free users get access to 3 languages, while Pro and Enterprise users get all 12. We're actively working on adding more languages based on user demand. ISL support is available for all Indian language content."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    category: "Technical",
    question: "How do I integrate Smart Captions into my application?",
    answer: "We offer multiple integration options: <strong>JavaScript SDK</strong> for web applications, <strong>REST API</strong> for backend integration, <strong>Webhooks</strong> for event notifications, and <strong>Embeddable Player</strong> for quick implementation. Our documentation includes code examples, tutorials, and SDKs for popular frameworks. Pro users get 10K API requests/month, and Enterprise users get unlimited access."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    category: "Technical",
    question: "Is my data secure and private?",
    answer: "Yes! We take security seriously. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). We're GDPR compliant and follow SOC 2 Type II standards. Your content is never used to train our public models without explicit permission. Enterprise customers can opt for on-premise deployment for complete data control. Read our <a href='#privacy' class='text-green-600 hover:underline'>Privacy Policy</a> for details."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    category: "Accessibility",
    question: "How does Smart Captions improve accessibility?",
    answer: "Smart Captions goes beyond basic transcription to provide true accessibility. We offer adaptive complexity levels for cognitive accessibility, ISL integration for the deaf community, speaker identification for context, emotional cues through emojis, and keyboard navigation for motor accessibility. Our platform is WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant and designed with input from accessibility advocates."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    category: "Accessibility",
    question: "Can I use Smart Captions with screen readers?",
    answer: "Yes! Our interface is fully compatible with popular screen readers including JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts are available for all functions, and captions can be navigated sequentially. We regularly test with assistive technology users to ensure the best experience."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    category: "Accessibility",
    question: "Do you support other sign languages besides ISL?",
    answer: "Currently, we focus on Indian Sign Language (ISL) as it serves our primary user base in India. However, we're exploring support for ASL (American Sign Language), BSL (British Sign Language), and other sign languages. Enterprise customers with specific needs can work with us to integrate custom sign language content."
